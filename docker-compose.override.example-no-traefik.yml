# Use this when replypilot.dk is served by nginx (or another proxy) on the HOST,
# not by Traefik in Docker. Copy to docker-compose.override.yml then:
#   docker compose up -d --force-recreate api
# Point your proxy at http://127.0.0.1:3000 for replypilot.dk.
#
# With this override, only one api replica runs and port 3000 is published
# so the host proxy can reach it.
